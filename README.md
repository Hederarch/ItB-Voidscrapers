*Version 1.1 out now!*

This is a new squad for Into the Breach. Just extract the zip and put it right in the game's mods folder.

Feedback is preferred on the relevant channels of the official discord (or the specialized thread if that's still available): https://discord.gg/xRxPAb87JW

Check the Issues tab for known bugs that are being worked on.

Looking for another of my squads? You can find it here: https://github.com/Hederarch/ItB-Tin-Tyrants

*(also these do require the Into the Breach modloader. That shouldn't be a problem for most people but download it if you don't have it.)*

## What's Included
This mod adds a new squad based around rapidly repositioning Vek for the black hole to devour.

The **Palanquin Mech** contains a raw singularity and can harness its power to instantly destroy a nearby unit, but its immense weight makes the mech very slow. Use the other mechs to toss valuable targets into its range.

The **Orbit mech** rotates nearby units around a central point, swapping their positions and dealing damage on impact.

![flipmortar_demo](https://github.com/Hederarch/ItB-Voidscrapers/assets/66890769/87b46546-6f07-4386-829c-e8da53b8de7a)

The **Flux Mech** can shoot through anything to spread out groups and precisely move Vek. 

![fluxgun_demo](https://github.com/Hederarch/ItB-Voidscrapers/assets/66890769/26bf8725-4a9d-4a48-b8bb-3681b62c7de9)
